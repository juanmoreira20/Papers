# Base
My research is focused on time delay and LPV systems using optimization techniques, mainly convex optimization in the form of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI's). Time-delay instability is dealt with a predictor based approach, in the sense that it will be applied the SFSP controller. Some results regarding input saturation will be added after the paper is published.
